On September 12, 2018, the U.S. Department of State lifted the ordered departure of non-emergency U.S. government personnel and family members. The U.S. Embassy in Managua is open to the public and provides the full range of consular services. Throughout Nicaragua, armed and violent uniformed police or civilians in plain clothes acting as police (\xe2\x80\x9cpara-police\xe2\x80\x9d) continue to target anyone considered to be in opposition to the rule of President Ortega. The government and its affiliated armed groups have been reported to:  Arbitrarily detain pro-democracy protestors, with credible claims of torture and disappearances. Systematically target opposition figures, including clergy, human rights advocates, and members of the press. Prevent certain individuals from departing Nicaragua by air or land. Seize private property. Arbitrarily search personal phones and computers for anti-government content. Arbitrarily detain certain individuals with unfounded charges of terrorism, money laundering, and organized crime.  These police and para-police groups often cover their faces, sometimes operate in groups numbering in the hundreds, and use unmarked vehicles. Rallies and demonstrations in opposition to the rule of President Ortega have been declared unlawful, but nevertheless occur. Government forces, uniformed police, and para-police have attacked peaceful demonstrators leading to significant numbers of arrests, injuries, and deaths. Looting, vandalism, and arson often occur during unrest. Road blocks, including in Managua and other major cities, may appear and limit availability of food and fuel. Government hospitals are understaffed and may deny treatment to suspected protestors. Some hospitals throughout the country may not be able to assist in emergencies. Ambulances have reportedly refused to respond or have been denied access to areas with individuals needing emergency care. Violent crime, such as sexual assault and armed robbery, is common. Civil unrest and poor infrastructure in parts of the country limit the Embassy\xe2\x80\x99s ability to assist U.S. citizens in emergencies. U.S. government personnel must avoid demonstrations and require special permission to travel beyond a three-hour drive from Managua. Additional restrictions on movements by U.S. government personnel may be put in place at any time, depending on local circumstances and security conditions, which can change suddenly.
